# Text-Adventure
Short text-based adventure game based on the TV show 'Attack on Titan'.

This is "Titan Slayer", a simple text-based adventure game you can play straight from the command line.  

When you start the game you awake in a field surrounded by your dead comrades with no weapon and no fuel for your ODM gear. In the distance you see an incoming titan, however you have no way to defend yourself.  You are then given the choice to either run for a fuel depot in the forest or seek shelter in a cave where you know weapons are stored.  Your story begins here and whether you live or die is dependant on your decisions.

As with all of my projects on GitHub I'm using this script as a method for me to better my programming skills, however I still welcome anyone who wants to contribute to my projects to do so.

Thanks for checking out Titan Slayer! -Coty Williams
